# Agent Skills

A collection of reusable Agent Skills for Cursor to standardize and accelerate AI-assisted development workflows.

**Documentation:** See the [complete specification](https://agentskills.io/llms.txt) for the official Agent Skills format.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are instructions that teach Cursor's AI agent how to perform specific, repeatable tasks according to your project conventions. When a skill is referenced, the agent reads its instructions and follows a defined workflow — ensuring consistent output every time.

See the [Cursor Skills Documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills) for more details.

## Repository Structure

```
skills/
└── [skill-name]/
    ├── SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition with frontmatter and instructions
    ├── references/           # Optional: supporting documentation files
    ├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code/utilities
    └── assets/               # Optional: templates, images, data files
```

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill must contain a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown body.

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase, numbers, hyphens only. No leading/trailing hyphens. Must match parent directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. Should describe WHAT it does and WHEN to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference (e.g., "MIT", "Apache-2.0") |
| `compatibility` | No | Environment requirements, system packages, network access needs. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value pairs for additional context. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools. (Experimental) |

### Body Content

The Markdown body after frontmatter contains the skill instructions. Recommended sections:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Workflow examples
- Validation checklist
- Edge cases and considerations

**Context Efficiency:** Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files in `references/`.

## Optional Directories

### `references/`
Supporting documentation loaded on-demand by agents:
- `REFERENCE.md` - Technical reference
- `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
- Domain-specific files (`finance.md`, `legal.md`, etc.)

### `scripts/`
Executable code agents can run:
- Python, Bash, JavaScript, etc.
- Must be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
- Include helpful error messages

### `assets/`
Static resources:
- Document templates, configuration templates
- Diagrams, images, examples
- Lookup tables, schemas

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
